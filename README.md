Musical Sacrifice
=================

A magical multiplayer party game, inspired by Wario Ware, with Shakespearian sensibilities. 

* Peer-to-peer LAN multiplayer just by visiting a web page
* Best played with Chrome or Firefox on the desktop
* Use cursor keys for movement and ALT to kick Yorick's skull (alas)
* Type messages to other players
* Supports game controllers, plays well with an XBOX360 controller

Pro tip: Use a custom URL to ensure only members of your LAN join. For example: https://github.com/rocket-hands/MusicalSacrifice/#MyCompany

More levels and a rock-solid engine will be arriving in the weeks following GGJ16.
