* figure out how to restrict peer connection to the same LAN
* build a common game state for levels: prepare, play, celebrate
  + prepare phase shows instructions, players, countdown
  + play phase shows countdown, score
  + celebrate phase focuses on winner
  + sync state and so on
  + level controls spawn points and such
* prevent new players from spawning during a level; process spawns when level inits
* flesh out the lobby, add player name and team name perhaps (if needed for peer restriction)
* add speech bubbles with typed messages
* design six different thematic levels
